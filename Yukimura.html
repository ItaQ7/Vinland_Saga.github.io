        <img src="t1.jpg" alt="" class="flt">
        <h4>Early life:</h4>
        <p>Yukimura considered himself a laidback child at school.<br> The first manga he read was Akira Toriyama's Dr. Slump at 5; he was particularly impressed by its cover.<br> He then watched the anime much to his surprise because he did not see the need of a story being repeated.<br> When Yukimura became 16, he had the idea of becoming a manga author.<br> During his early life, Yukimura was nearly killed in two car accidents.<br> This made him reconsider his way of thinking.<br> He believes he had no social life and barely paid attention to classes in his childhood.<br> The only thing he wrote in his notebook was manga.<br> He graduated from Chuo University and Suginami High School.<br> In contrast to other students, Yukimura faced no hardships in graduating and recalls having brief anxiety.<br> Yukimura's crisis with school and lack of interest with his growth and jobs worried his parents.<br> However, Yukimura's school life changed when being taught by a literature teacher who used Michael Ende, famous for The Never Ending Story, in a class.<br>

            Yukimura was first inspired to become a manga artist after reading Fist of the North Star as a boy.<br> He said he had always wanted to produce a series which reflected the same themes of "strength and justice".<br> However, he felt that he would not accomplish his dream due to poor academic skills.<br> Eventually, he started studying manga at 16 and was recruited as an assistant two years later.<br> His parents convinced him of graduating first from high school.<br> He never drew manga on his own until his debut.<br> Once graduating from college at 22, he met Kaiji Kawaguchi, who found his potential to become a manga author.<br> He met Dai Morimura, who taught him about drawing manga and finding his own style rather than imitating others.<br> Yukimura got married during his work as an assistant, who supported him.<br> In regards to his family, Yukimura mentioned he has two children, with the second one being born in 2006.<br> With the later birth of another child, Yukimura revealed that all were male but was worried about their health.<br></p>
            <h4>Career:</h4>
            <p>
                Yukimura made his debut with the hard science fiction manga Planetes, serialized in Weekly Morning magazine from 1999 to 2004 and adapted into a 26-episode anime series by Sunrise.<br> Before that, he worked as an assistant for Shin Morimura.<br>

He is currently working on Vinland Saga, which was first serialized in Weekly Shōnen Magazine then moved to the monthly Afternoon magazine due to release pacing issues.<br> He was inspired by the anime series Vicky the Viking he watched as a child, and since then, he has been fascinated with Vikings.<br> For this work, he received the 2009 Japan Media Arts Festival Grand Prize in the manga category.<br> In 2010, he was a guest of the Angoulême International Comics Festival.<br> As of July 2021, the manga had over 5.5 million copies in circulation.<br> While the series is notable for its amount of violence normally caused by Vikings, Yukimura claimed he hates the concept of violence.<br> As a result, a key element in writing this story was relaxing his modern sense of morality.<br>
